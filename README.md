# Gift Certifications Project

The Gift Certifications Project is a web application that allows users to browse, purchase, and manage gift certificates. Each gift certificate can be associated with one or more tags, and users can create orders to purchase gift certificates.


The Gift Certifications Project aims to provide a platform where users can explore available gift certificates, view associated tags, and place orders for their desired certificates. The project uses a combination of Spring Boot, JPA, and RESTful APIs to achieve these functionalities.

Features:

Browse and search for gift certificates.
View details of individual gift certificates, including associated tags.
Place orders for gift certificates.
User authentication and registration.
